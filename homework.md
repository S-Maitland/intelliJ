1. Breakpoint is used to stop the program from running at the line in which we put a breakpoint.


2. No it does not run that line of code, but rather stops at that line ready to run it next.


3. We can use shift + F9 or main menu > Run > Debug.


4. Stepping in means to go through each line within a function/program code to check for errors in the logic.


5. With evaluate expression we can enter a singular expression into the window and it will give us the result of that expression, with evaluate code fragment it will let us run multiple lines of codes and hold variables.
